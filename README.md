# QuadPay Technical Interview

QuadPay is a payment gateway that lets consumers split purchases into 4 interest free installments, every two weeks. The first 25% is taken when the purchase is made, and the remaining 3 installments of 25% are automatically taken every 14 days. We help customers manage their cash-flow while helping merchants increase conversion rates and average order values.

## Programming Interview

The programming interview will consist of a 1h discussion with one of our engineers and will revolve around a pair programming exercise.
We have prepared a project that is available in 4 languages (C#, Java, Python, Node.js). Please choose the one you are most comfortable with.

This project is designed to help you become familiar with our problem domain and start to think about which scenarios we should anticipate going forward. It gives us an opportunity to evaluate how you handle some of the edge cases we've encountered while building the QuadPay platform.

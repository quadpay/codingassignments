## Coding Challenge

QuadPay is a payment gateway that lets consumers split purchases into 4 interest free installments, every two weeks. The first 25% is taken when the order is received, and the remaining 3 installments of 25% are automatically taken every 14 days. We help customers manage their cash-flow and we help merchants increase conversion rates and average order values.

It may help to see our product in action (https://naadam.co/products/unisex-cashmere-hoodie-black) and read our documentation (https://docs.quadpay.com).

In the future, we'd like to be able to offer flexible installment schedules to our customers to help them better manage their cash flow. For example, we might want to let customers choose both the number of Installments their purchase is split into as well as the timespan between each installment.

This coding assignment is designed to help you become familiar with our problem domain and start to think about which scenarios we should anticipate going forward. It gives us an opportunity to evaluate how you handle some of the edge cases we've encountered while building the QuadPay platform.
Codebase starter-kit

There are two projects in this solution:
* QuadPay.Domain contains domain objects for you to work with. You'll notice some of the implementation is stubbed out and marked with TODOs. There may be some methods or properties missing, feel free to add more as you see fit.
* QuadPay.Test contains a few example xUnit Unit Tests (all failing). 
 
See if you can get the existing tests passing by fleshing out the missing PaymentPlan implementations. Feel free to add new tests to increase code coverage and ensure that weâ€™re properly checking edge cases.
